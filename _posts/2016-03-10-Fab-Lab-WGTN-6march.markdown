### Object's effect & Object Affects - personal experimental research

### This was my start 

In psychology of art, the relationship between art and emotion has newly been the subject of extensive study. Emotional or aesthetic responses to art have previously been viewed as basic stimulus response, but new theories and research have suggested that these experiences are more complex and able to be studied experimentally.[1] Emotional responses are often regarded as the keystone to experiencing art, and the creation of an emotional experience has been argued as the purpose of artistic expression.[2]Research has shown that the neurological underpinnings of perceiving art differ from those used in standard object recognition.[3] Instead, brain regions involved in the experience of emotion and goal setting show activation when viewing art.[3]
