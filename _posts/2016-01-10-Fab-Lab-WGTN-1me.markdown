Hello everybody 

{% include image.html url="image/gif/quadri.gif" description="Paintings" %}

My name is Lucia Arcangeli, I’m 28 years old, I was born in Cervara di Roma, the highest  municipality of  “Valle dell’Aniene” far 70Km from Rome Italy.
I grew up in a unique  environment, my village full of creativity; of art, paintings, writings, poetry and sculpture.
I  love sports  and nature which is why my studies were multifaceted, from architecture to sports.
During my studies in architecture I had the opportunity to learn and to test not only in the field of buildings all the different kind of buildings, but also in the field of sport. In particular I teach people swimming and climbing, that permits me to learn the value of collaboration, verbal learning and nonverbal learning,  putting me in contact with different ages.
I graduated recently in “Architecture and Construction Techniques”, my thesis was about prototyping, a subject very actual at the moment.

I focused on Prototyping concept “model/prototype”, above all in the Theoretical representation and Experimental Aspect 
I choose this, attracted to new techniques of digital print having relevancy in architecture and design field also.
It’s  for these reasons that today I focus on the FABLAB’s  reality, to discover and learn all the aspects of prototyping.
