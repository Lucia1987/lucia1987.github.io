In particular we needed the file to Design a head for Create A big real Chinese lion for a ceremony .

### E. Creation of my first t-shirt
Learning about pattern making

### F. Team project:  Open Design & Digital Fabrication 
Observe students working on a project to understand how to develop an idea , in this case the issue is the Light , The lamp 

### F.1. About Team project 1st Week:  Open Design & Digital Fabrication

Aim: In this studio paper students will utilise open design methodologies and digital fabrication tools to produce an open design project. They will explore the possibilities and articulate issues related to an open design phylosophy whilst developing skills in making and digital fabrication.

In groups of three, you will investigate the idea of open design and apply what you’re learned to a design project, expanding and developing an existing open design concept and redistributing your developed design into the word for others to evaluate and work with.

The project will be tackled in groups. Fab lab wgtn will provide a short list of open design concept for your group to select from. Your group is required to develop an existing open concept. The Fab Lab will short- list a range of concepts from which you can choose. The Fab Lab has a wide variety of resources to utilise, and we would like to see you explore a number of these in detail. Pick a project that has potential to use 2-3 separate processes to complete it.

### 1st Week Open Design & Digital Fabrication was about:

Introduction to the Paper, introduction the brief, introduction to Fab Lab WGTN.

Costruction project groups - Team Parsnip, Team Wawy, Team Illumination

Research and studio, development idea.

Introduction of open design Whakapapa

By group research presentations

### F.1.1. Manifesto

### Team Parsnip

As a team we want to utlise our skills,disciplines and interests as a way to learn of eachother and produce a more resolved Open deisgn outcome. We will work as a family of designers that are there to support our group and others. Every idea,opinion, and voice will be heard to help us visualise the bigger picture. Encouraging eachother to speak there minds, and supporting them when done.We want to be inspired and curious by other artists, designers and products. Overall we want to design and create a object that is both visually and digitally compelling.Our product will go through many stages of development and will be based around budget but we will not treat this as target.Through design and play we want create a sense of joy and happiness for the user.Making individuals more aware of the creative ways they can use their senses.

### Team Wavy

Our team has a wide range of design specialisations, which allows for the overseeing of certain areas of expertise. Collectively we aim to face this project with a flexible approach to task delegation. This means that our specialisations will not limit the scope of our contributions to the project, which will allow for an openness to learning if a member wants to lead or assist on a task.

This way of converging differing interests and coordinating the outcome will be paired with a focus on designing for fine aesthetic, a sense of wonder, inspiration for innovation, and the encouragement of open design through accessibility.

### Team Illumination 

overview: In this studio paper students will utilise open design methodologies and digital fabrication tools to produce an open design project. They will explore the possibilities and articulate issues related to an open design philosophy whilst developing skills in making and digital fabrication.

OVER THE FIRST WEEK OF THE PROJECT! See you in February for other developments!




## The knowledge through the experience in my opinion is the key to personal growth.
