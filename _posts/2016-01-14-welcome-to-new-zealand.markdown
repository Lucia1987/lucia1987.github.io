Hello everybody, I introduce myself:

My name is Lucia Arcangeli, I’m 28 years old, I was born in Cervara di Roma, the highest  municipality of  “Valle dell’Aniene” far 70Km from Rome Italy.
I grew up in a unique  environment, my village full of creativity; of art, paintings, writings, poetry and sculpture.
I  love sports  and nature which is why my studies were multifaceted, from architecture to sports.
During my studies in architecture I had the opportunity to learn and to test not only in the field of buildings all the different kind of buildings, but also in the field of sport. In particular I teach people swimming and climbing, that permits me to learn the value of collaboration, verbal learning and nonverbal learning,  putting me in contact with different ages.
I graduated recently in “Architecture and Construction Techniques”, my thesis was about prototyping, a subject very actual at the moment. 
I focused on Prototyping concept “model/prototype”, above all in the Theoretical representation and Experimental Aspect 
I choose this, attracted to new techniques of digital print having relevancy in architecture and design field also.
It’s  for these reasons that today I focus on the FABLAB’s  reality, to discover and learn all the aspects of prototyping.

The knowledge through the experience!

I am participating in a “regionally based EU project” that allows me to be in relation with two different job realities, one abroad, in Fab Lab Wgtn, and the second here in Italy, in my own region Lazio inside the "Fab Lab SPQWork"of Rome.

The target of initiative is:

Intelligent: acknowledge and innovation

Sustainable: economy more efficient, more green and competitive

Inclusive: economy to promote occupation and social cohesion

The aim is to upgrade different skills of recipients and create real conditions for the execution of a “job” experience .
The project will be in two steps:

Project's name "I’ll return soon" (Liberal interpretation)

Step1 outside of Italy from 3 to 6 months (Sydney Australia & Wellington New Zealand)

Firstly, I attended an English course in Sydney in order to improve my English, so that I can work in any part of the word. It’s just for a short time because I have only six months out of Italy to improve my English.

Secondly, I’m in New Zealand, through an invitation from Massey University FAB LAB WGTN (thank you Wendy)

Step2 in my own region from 3 to 6 months again (Rome Italy)

I have another three months in Italy for a 3rd part of this project in a Prototype laboratory in Rome FAB LAB SPQWoRk (thank you Tommaso)
My proposal wants to analyze which is the way to work abroad, in the field prototyping, and in the other side how it works in Italy. 

Project experience who lives across the world!

I have chosen Oceania to propose a bilateral project between two different world’s reality, Italy and New Zealand, Geographical Antipodes, to enlarge my cultural and linguistic skills, having a school level of english and because I’d like to know that country for its culture and also for its nature and landscapes.
I love technical and art drawing that is always with me since I was child.

In the different workplaces where I have been  I learned the importance of team work and the concept of responsibilities at work.
 “I want to learn and, believe me, I'm a very hard worker” 
 
I decided to do that, because I graduated in March 2015 in Architecture and I think it’s a good opportunity for me.

I need to improve my experience not only for my study, but in particular “to enhance my skills in this field of architecture” to help me make a final decision about my future...

To be continued...
