### - About Fab Lab WGTN 

Fab Lab Wgtn is a digital fabrication laboratory equipped with accessible computer-controlled tools able to make almost anything. 
Incubator of design ideas, a maker of possibilities, a creative ecosystem, and a place that gives anyone and everyone the technology to power their ideas.
Part of a growing global network of Fab Labs affiliated to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Fab Lab Wgtn was Australasia’s first and sits within the School of Design at Massey University Wellington.

Managing Fab Lab Wgtn is furniture designer, Wendy Neale. With a digital and craft-based practice, Wendy designs and creates meaningful objects from waste and obsolete furniture, and also develops furniture with modified traditional joints using digital techniques. She’s most excited when combining the two.

Supporting the creators using Fab Lab Wgtn is Craig Hobern, a digital media designer with a background in embedded electronics. Craig is passionate about interactive and mixed media works, open source design projects and about helping designers have new adventures with digital and cnc processes.

There are a number of other designers working through Fab Lab Wgtn, with diverse experience and skills, from the broader community as well as within Massey.
