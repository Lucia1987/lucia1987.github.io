Italian Project "Torno Subito"  "I’ll return soon"

I am participating in a “regionally based EU project” this initiative is to utilise the resources provided by the European Social Fund (ESF), 2014-2020, for the strengthening of human capital. 
The aim is to upgrade different skills of recipients and create real conditions for the execution of a “job” experience .That allows me to be in relation with two different realities, one abroad, in Fab Lab Wgtn, and the second here in Italy, in my own region Lazio inside the "Fab Lab SPQwoRk" of Rome.

The target of initiative is:

- Intelligent: acknowledge and innovation

- Sustainable: economy more efficient, more green and competitive

- Inclusive: economy to promote occupation and social cohesion

Individuals eligible to present a proposal

Individuals eligible to apply: university students, university graduates, graduates of Technical High Schools, Italian citizens or foreigners who have been resident in Lazio for at least 6 months, aged between 18-35 years old. 

Torno Subito  Estero – TSE : as outlined in Phase 1 outside the region, outside of Italy, for a period of 3 to 6 months, as well as an experience of Phase 2 in Lazio, through internships and/or research projects, for a period ranging between 3 to 6 months.


The project will be in two steps:

### Step1

- outside of Italy from 3 to 6 months (Sydney Australia & Wellington New Zealand)

Firstly, I attended an English course in Sydney in order to improve my English, so that I can work in any part of the word. It’s just for a short time because I have only six months out of Italy to improve my English.

Secondly, I’m in New Zealand, through an invitation from Massey University FAB LAB WGTN (thank you Wendy)
Fab Lab Wgtn is a digital fabrication laboratory equipped with accessible computer-controlled tools able to make almost anything. 

Think of Fab Lab as an invention playground, an incubator of design ideas, a maker of possibilities, a creative ecosystem, and a place that gives anyone and everyone the technology to power their ideas.
Part of a growing global network of Fab Labs affiliated to MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Fab Lab Wgtn was Australasia’s first and sits within the School of Design at Massey University Wellington.

### Step2

- in my own region from 3 to 6 months again (Rome Italy)

I have another three months in Italy for a 3rd part of this project in a Prototype laboratory in Rome FAB LAB SPQwoRk (thank you Tommaso)

Open access to a wide range of tools, equipment, resources and work space. 
The FabLab SPQwoRk is aimed at young people and adults, but also children and young people of school age. 
Giving space to ideas that do not fit in most home workshops, access to a generational exchange of knowledge, focusing on the strong tradition of quality craftsmanship that has always characterized Italy, integrating it with the possibilities offered by digital fabrication. 
Fablab SPQwoRk has the intent to collect and cultivate highly creative working groups for the development of collaborative synergies between producers, thinkers , students, academics and entrepreneurs who share ideas , and want to create new products , new businesses to work, acquiring new abilities. An initiative of this kind would have an immeasurable impact on the community . 
Fablab SPQwoRk is dedicated to : 
( fabber ) A place where people meet to discuss a possible project , then go directly to the development of the same ... 
(artisans and start-up) a place where groped to start your own business becomes simplified to the bone , with no initial investment, available over the machinery for the job, a consulting service and risk analysis / feasibility of the business. 
( makers) a place where you can do all that at home you can no longer do 
(students) to form a place to work that matters 
( children) a place to develop the creativity of their children as a playground of the work 
( students ) a place to train and mix their skills

My proposal wants to analyze which is the way to work abroad, in the field prototyping, and in the other side how it works in Italy.

### Project experience who lives across the world!

I have chosen Oceania to propose a bilateral project between two different world’s reality, Italy and New Zealand, Geographical Antipodes, to enlarge my cultural and linguistic skills, having a school level of english and because I’d like to know that country for its culture and also for its nature and landscapes.
I love technical and art drawing that is always with me since I was child.

In the different workplaces where I have been  I learned the importance of team work and the concept of responsibilities at work.
 “I want to learn and, believe me, I'm a very hard worker” 
 
I decided to do that, because I graduated in March 2015 in Architecture and I think it’s a good opportunity for me.

I need to improve my experience not only for my study, but in particular “to enhance my skills in this field of architecture” to help me make a final decision about my future...

To be continued...
