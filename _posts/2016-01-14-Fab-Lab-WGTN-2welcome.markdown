Italian Project "Torno Subito"  "I’ll return soon"

I am participating in a “regionally based EU project” this initiative is to utilise the resources provided by the European Social Fund (ESF), 2014-2020, for the strengthening of human capital. 
The aim is to upgrade different skills of recipients and create real conditions for the execution of a “job” experience .That allows me to be in relation with two different realities, one abroad, in Fab Lab Wgtn, and the second here in Italy, in my own region Lazio inside the "Fab Lab SPQwoRk" of Rome.

The target of initiative is:

- Intelligent: acknowledge and innovation

- Sustainable: economy more efficient, more green and competitive

- Inclusive: economy to promote occupation and social cohesion


Torno Subito  Estero – TSE : as outlined in Phase 1 outside the region, outside of Italy, for a period of 3 to 6 months, as well as an experience of Phase 2 in Lazio, through internships and/or research projects, for a period ranging between 3 to 6 months.

The project will be in two steps:

### Step1

- outside of Italy from 3 to 6 months (Sydney Australia & Wellington New Zealand)

Firstly, I attended an English course in Sydney in order to improve my English, so that I can work in any part of the word. It’s just for a short time because I have only six months out of Italy to improve my English.

Secondly, I’m in New Zealand, through an invitation from Massey University FAB LAB WGTN (thank you Wendy)

### Step2

- in my own region from 3 to 6 months again (Rome Italy)

I have another three months in Italy for a 3rd part of this project in a Prototype laboratory in Rome FAB LAB SPQwoRk (thank you Tommaso)
My proposal wants to analyze which is the way to work abroad, in the field prototyping, and in the other side how it works in Italy.

### Project experience who lives across the world!

I have chosen Oceania to propose a bilateral project between two different world’s reality, Italy and New Zealand, Geographical Antipodes, to enlarge my cultural and linguistic skills, having a school level of english and because I’d like to know that country for its culture and also for its nature and landscapes.
I love technical and art drawing that is always with me since I was child.

In the different workplaces where I have been  I learned the importance of team work and the concept of responsibilities at work.
 “I want to learn and, believe me, I'm a very hard worker” 
 
I decided to do that, because I graduated in March 2015 in Architecture and I think it’s a good opportunity for me.

I need to improve my experience not only for my study, but in particular “to enhance my skills in this field of architecture” to help me make a final decision about my future...

To be continued...
